                        Hello there. I'm Yi (pronounced as the letter "e"). On the left you might see a pictorial representation of my face.

                        I'm currently a <script>writeGetOrdinalYear()</script> Ph.D. student in the CSD at CMU, where I have the privilege to have Bryan Parno as my advisor. Prior to that, I received my B.S. and M.S. from UIUC, where I was very fortunate to have Michael Bailey as my advisor.

                        My research interest is mainly in applied formal methods, where we perform formal analysis and proofs on real systems to ensure the correctness and security.

                        In my free time, I like to lift weights, though I am quite terrible at it. I also enjoy playing the electric guitar, but I am not great at that either. If you like memes, checkout my collection of youtube memes here. </a>
